## /paladins match update
**Changes:**
- Moved the Rank icon and Party numbers around to not cause issues with high KDA stats.
 - Will display in front of the rank if in a competitive game
 - Will be moved further away from the KDA text if in a non-competitive game
- Loadouts/Items image now gets generated right after the message is sent rather than when the button is pressed.
 - This means that the image will be shown faster when first clicking on it.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed Talus' "*Faustian Bargain*" talent not displaying
- Fixed an issue where sometimes the 2 new bans would not display in the Loadout/Items image.

**Fixes for loadout images/cards in general:**
- Fixed Kinessa's new passive card "*Eagle Eye*" not displaying.
- Fixed scaling text issues with Saati's "*Seek*" card.
