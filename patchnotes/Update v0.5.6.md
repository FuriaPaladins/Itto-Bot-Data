# Update v0.5.6

## Paladins - Big stats update!
### `/paladins stats champions`
**Changes:**
- Added "Talents" to the options you can choose from queries

### Big Change
- **The stats are now updated every 2 hours but only matches within the past 2 weeks are stored and displayed. This is done for sake of performance and storage space.**
 - The bot's status is changed to "Streaming Paladins Match Data" when it is collecting data.
### Revamped all the options:
- Average Stats per Minute
- Win/Pick rates for cards
- Win/Pick rates for items
- Win/Pick rates for skins
- Win/Pick rates for talents
- Win/Pick/Ban rates
*More will definitely be added later. If you'd like to suggest some feel free to post about it!*
