# Update v0.5.3
## Hoyolab Linking
Changed and cleaned up how it is displayed. Now allows you to link your Starrail and Genshin UID's. (For future functions)

## Star Rail
**Commands are renamed**
- `/star_rail` is now `/starrail`

### Battle Chronicle is added to Star Rail! 
*(More commands will come in the next updates, I just wanted to release this so people can view their TP in star rail)*

### `/starrail profile info `
- Allows you to view your Trailblaze Power and Expeditions

## Announcements
Command for announcements is temporarily disabled as I work on a new announcements system

## Daily Redemption
Moved over to a new (and much faster) way of redeeming daily rewards
This could potentially mean daily rewards will not be redeemed, but I will monitor and fix as need be
