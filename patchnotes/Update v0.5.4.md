# Update v0.5.4
# Paladins
## `/paladins loadout`
Fixes:
- Now will fallback to the default image if your custom URL is invalid/has an error

## `/paladins random loadout`
New command!
Allows you to randomly generate a loadout and talent for a specific champion.

## *A lot of miscellaneous fixes for some commands that are too insignificant to mention here*
