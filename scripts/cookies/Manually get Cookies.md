4. You need "ltoken" and "ltuid" keys. You may search for these with the "filter" at the top of the page.  
5. Be sure to grab the v2 version of these cookies if they are present.  
 - EG: If both ltoken and ltoken_v2 are present, only get the ltoken_v2.  
6. You must format it something like:  
 - ltoken=[Insert ltoken here]; ltuid=[Insert ltuid here];  
7. Paste this into the bot where it asks you to, and if you did it correctly, it will link your account properly.
