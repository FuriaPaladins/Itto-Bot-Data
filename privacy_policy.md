# Privacy Policy for Itto Bot

## Here you can see what data the bot will store for different commands

**Storing Message Content**
```
The bot only ever stores your message content if an error is thrown. This is so that I, (the bot developer), can see what went wrong and how to reproduce it to fix it.
```

**What info is stored for Paladins?**
```
The only information that /link paladins stores is your Paladins username and your Paladins ID. These are mapped to your discord ID, and are only ever used to get your Paladins stats when you run any /paladins related features that require an account input.
You can remove this stored data by simply pressing the unlink button in /link paladins
```

**What info is stored for Genshin/Star Rail?**
```
Genshin stores your login cookies and maps them to your discord ID. These are used for account specific /genshin commands, such as viewing your own characters, resin count, commission completion, and other features found on mihoyo's hoyolab website.
You can remove this stored data by simply pressing the unlink button in /link hoyolab
```

**Customisation Settings**
```
The bot stores your customisation settings for 2 commands as of this, /paladins match, and /paladins loadouts. These settings are stored for your own customisation. You specify which colours you want for your match image, and the bot will only store these values. This is the same for loadouts, where an image URL is stored for each champion that you want a custom image for.
```

**What info is stored for /announcements?**
```
For all announcements, the only data stored is the channel ID that the announcement is meant to be sent in. If the announcement is DM-only, then it stores the user ID for the direct messages. This can be removed by simply running the announcements command again
```

NOTE:
If you ever wish to delete any of your data stored by the bot, please DM the bot developer, @Furi√£, or join the [Bot Development server](https://discord.gg/hme7QP5uGd "Bot Development server") and ask for your data to be removed.
